# odin-landing-page

The Odin Project - Landing Page Project:

This project helped reinforece the following lessons:

- Flexbox
- Alignment & Axes
- Grouping Selector & Chaining Selector

I found great value in this project because it helped me get a better understanding of basic workflow:

- Reviewing the requirements, colors, fonts & desired end result
- Thinking through how to structure the landing page in an efficient way
- Determining what elements had common css properties
- Build out each section by following the following wor
  - Add HTML
  - Add CSS
  - Commit after each section

During this project I took some time to review / research each type of css length unit & their common usecases. I went back through the project and updated all the font, margin and padding units from px to rem.
